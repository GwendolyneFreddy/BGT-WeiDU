<h3>A Spellhold Studios mod for Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal<h3>

</div><br />

Baldur's Gate Trilogy is a modification originally created by Bardez that aimed to achieve two major goals: to play Baldur's Gate and Tales of the Sword Coast expansion using the much improved Baldur's Gate II engine, and to generate some kind of continuity between the events of Baldur's Gate, Tales of the Sword Coast, Shadows of Amn, and Throne of Bhaal. Baldur's Gate Trilogy-WeiDU takes this a step further by converting the modification to WeiDU format, which has improved compatibility with other modifications.

While BGT-WeiDU remains mostly faithful to the original Baldur's Gate and Tales of the Sword Coast, a number of new features have been introduced to satisfy the above goals.

- **Baldur's Gate using the Baldur's Gate II engine:** BGT-WeiDU is a modification installed on Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal. Therefore, the story of Baldur's Gate can be experienced with the updated graphics, better resolution, and interface improvements present in Baldur's Gate II.
- **Bug fixes:** BGT-WeiDU includes an internal fixpack that addresses a significant number of bugs that remained in Baldur's Gate and Tales of the Sword Coast. A technical list of fixes can be found here.
- **Continuity from Baldur's Gate into Shadows of Amn:** BGT-WeiDU uses a dynamic system to transfer players from the end of Baldur's Gate to Shadows of Amn. A cover story is used, in which the player talks to Belt after Sarevok is defeated, and NPCs are conditionally imported into Shadows of Amn depending on what fate you led them to experience in Baldur's Gate.
- **Expansive compatibility with other modifications:** BGT-WeiDU is compatible with the latest versions of modifications in a mega-modification installation, as well as a large number of other fan-made modifications. This allows the player to expand the world of Baldur's Gate to an enormously rich location to explore. A compatibility list is available here.
- **Organised journal entries:** BGT-WeiDU utilises a full quest journal system and ensures that all Baldur's Gate journal entries are removed prior to the transition to Shadows of Amn. This prevents clogging up of the journal, which normally makes it hard to find important information in the journal.
- **Map Notes:** The advent of map notes makes it useful for the player to pin their own special locations. BGT-WeiDU comes with a number of map notes already inserted to help the player find particular buildings quickly, instead of running around like crazed chickens into every single house in a particular area.
