# File name: it must be the same as tp2 name: MyMod.tp2 => MyMod.ini (.hjson/.json5/.jsonc/.json)  
# File location: the same folder where .tp2 file is present  
# File content: every key=value pair is optional, key names are case insensitive

# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = Baldur's Gate Trilogy is a modification originally created by Bardez that aimed to achieve two major goals: to play Baldur's Gate and Tales of the Sword Coast expansion using the much improved Baldur's Gate II engine, and to generate some kind of continuity between the events of Baldur's Gate, Tales of the Sword Coast, Shadows of Amn, and Throne of Bhaal. Baldur's Gate Trilogy-WeiDU takes this a step further by converting the modification to WeiDU format, which has improved compatibility with other modifications.
